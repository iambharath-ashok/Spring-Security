# Spring Security Basic Authentication Example


-	Basic authentication is often used with stateless clients which pass their credentials on each request.
-	It’s quite common to use it in combination with form-based authentication where an application is used through both a browser-based user interface and as a web-service. 
-	However, basic authentication transmits the password as plain text 
-	so it should only really be used over an encrypted transport layer such as HTTPS.

-	Because basic authentication header has to be sent with each HTTP request, the web browser needs to cache the credentials for a reasonable period to avoid constant prompting user for the username and password.
 Caching policy differs between browsers.
 
 
 ## BasicAuth in Spring Security

-	Simplest possible solution to implement basic http authentication is to use “http-basic” tag in spring security configuration file like this:

		<http>
			<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER" />
			<http-basic />
		</http>
		
		
-	Above setting in your application will enforce the user to authenticate any of webpage or any other resource in your application.
-	Interesting thing is that you do not need to create any login page or session management mechanism.
-	Browser will present a login box before user on your behalf. And because each request contains authentication information just like in http stateless mechanism, you do not need to maintain session also.



## Basic Auth Demo

	application-security.xml:
	
	
		< ?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/security"
			xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
			xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
			xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/security
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-3.0.3.xsd">
		 
			<http auto-config="true"  use-expressions="true">
				<intercept-url pattern="/login" access="permitAll" />
				<intercept-url pattern="/logout" access="permitAll" />
				<intercept-url pattern="/accessdenied" access="permitAll" />
				<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="hasRole('ROLE_USER')" />
				<logout logout-success-url="/logout" />
				<http-basic />
			</http>
		 
			<authentication-manager alias="authenticationManager">
				<authentication-provider>
					<user-service>
						<user lokesh" password="password" authorities="ROLE_USER" />
					</user-service>
				</authentication-provider>
			</authentication-manager>

	
		
		
		
## Verify BasicAuth

-	1) Hit the URL “http://localhost:8080/Spring3HibernateIntegration” in browser
-	A login window appear. 
-	Please note that it is browser generated login box and application has only provided relevant headers to browser.
