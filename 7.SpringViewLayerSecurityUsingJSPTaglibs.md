# Spring View Layer Security using JSP Taglibs

-	We can secure our application with login form, url, method level
-	All these security implementations were on controller or model layer of MVC
-	We can also add security in view layer
-	It is mostly needed when we want to hide certain links or buttons based on user’s role so that he will not be able to access that functionality
-	To use Spring security tags in JSPs we need to add spring-security-taglibs dependency

## 	Taglib declaration

- 	To Secure view layer of application, spring Security has its own taglib 
-	Which provides basic support for accessing security information and applying security constraints in JSPs
-	To use security features in JSP file, following tag library declaration needs to added:

	<%@ taglib uri="http://www.springframework.org/security/tags" prefix="security" %>

-	we can choose the prefix of our own choice and we will need to use this prefix in JSP files


## Security tags

-	Spring provide basically 3 tags for securing view layer information i.e.

	-	authorize tag
	-	authenticate tag
	-	accesscontrollist tag
	
	
## 1.	Authorize Taglib


-	This tag is used to determine whether its contents should be evaluated or not
-	This tag has two flavors i.e. 
	-	Securing information based on user’s role 
	-	Or securing information based on user’s permission to access a particular URL
	
-	Sample usage will look like this:

			<security:authorize ifAnyGranted="ROLE_ADMIN">
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
						<input type="submit" value="<spring:message code="label.add"/>"/>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</security:authorize>
			 
			OR
			 
			<security:authorize url="/admin">
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
						<input type="submit" value="<spring:message code="label.add"/>"/>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</security:authorize>


##	2. authenticate tag

-	This tag is not for security purpose directly
-	But it can be used for accessing information which can be used for view layer security.
-	This tag allows access to the current Authentication object stored in the security context.
-	It renders a property of the object directly in the JSP.
-	So, for example, if the principal property of the Authentication is an instance of Spring Security’s UserDetails object
-	Then using <sec:authentication property=”principal.username”></sec:authentication> will render the name of the current user.

			<security:authentication property="principal.username" />

	
## 3. accesscontrollist tag

-	It is used to check whether user has valid permission for specific domain object.
-	This tag is only valid when used with Spring Security’s ACL module. 
-	It checks a comma-separated list of required permissions for a specified domain object. 
-	If the current user has any of those permissions, then the tag body will be evaluated.
-	If they don’t, it will be skipped.

			<sec:accesscontrollist hasPermission="1,2" domainObject="someObject">
				This will be shown if the user has either of the permissions
				represented by the values "1" or "2" on the given object.
			</sec:accesscontrollist>
