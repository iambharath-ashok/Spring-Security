# Spring Security


## What is Security?

-	Security is to make sure that only particular systems and person can access the resources
-	Controller access to resources
-	Security is used to make sure that only Authenticated people can access the resource and can perform specific set of actions/Operations that they were authorized for


## What is Spring Security

-	Spring Security is a framework that provides Authentication and Authorization mechanism for Spring based applications
-	Spring Security can be applied to REST JAX-RS application
-	Spring Security is plug and play, flexible 
-	Spring security is not related to:

	-	Firewall
	-	Proxy Server
	-	Intrusion Detection System
	-	OS Level Security
	-	JVM Security
	
	
## Major Operations

-	Authentication
	-	Tell me who you are
	-	Username and password
	-	Authentication is combination of Identification and verification
	-	Can be human or any other application systems

-	Authorization 

	-	Authorization is nothing but access control
	-	Application will have roles and based on role user will be able to perform the actions
	-	Admin, user, developer, tester
	-	Authorization is like we know who you are but will be able perform action based on the roles
	

## Servlet Filters

-	Servlet Filters is used to intercept the request and response before dispatching to Actual Servlets 
-	Like Auditing, Logging, Security
-	Servlet Filter has two methods 

	-	Pre Processing
	-	Post Processing

-	Whole Spring Security is based on Servlet Filter concept


## Spring Security Usecase

-	User will try to access the home page
-	He will be redirected to login page with spring security
-	If authentication is successful then will redirected to home otherwise will be redirected to login page

## Spring Security Setup

-	dependencies
	-	spring-security-config
	-	spring-security-core
	-	spring-security-web
	
-	Schema and xsd in spring-config.xml

	-	http://www.springframework.org/schema/security
	-	http://www.springframework.org/schema/security-3.0.xsd
	

	
## Enabling Spring Security - Configuration 1

-	Adding filter and filter mapping in application web.xml
	
	<filter>
		<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChaing</filter-name>
		<filter-class>org.spirngframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
	</filter>

	<filter-mapping>
		<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChaing</filter-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
	<filter-mapping>


## Enabling Spring Security - Configuration 2

-	spring-security-config.xml
	
	<beans>
		
		<http auto-config="true">
			<intercept-url pattern="/welcome*" access="ROLE_USER">
			<form-login login-page="/login" default-target-url="/welcome" authentication-failure-url="/loginFailed">
			<logout logout-success-url="/logout">
		</http>
		
		<authentication-manager>
			<authentication-provider>
				<user-service>
					<user name="abc" password="123" authorities="ROLE_USER"/>
				</user-service>
			</authentication-provider>
		</authentication-manager>
		
	</beans>
	

## 	Basic Architecture of Spring Security

-	Incoming request before reaching Dispatcher Servlet will went through many filters
-	Architecture has two details, Authentication manager and security context
-	Authentication Manager 

	-	What type of aunthentication mechanism 
	-	Text with username and password
	-	LDAP and DB
	
-	Security Context Provides details about Roles of the individual 
	-	Security Context holds all the details about the user who logged in
	



## Spring MVC Configuration with Spring Security


		<web-app>
			<display-name></display-name>
			<servlet>
				<servlet-name>mvc-dispatcher</servlet-name>
				<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
			</servlet>
			
			<servlet-mapping>
				<servlet-name>mvc-dispatcher</servlet-name>
				<servlet-mapping>/*</servlet-mapping>
			
			</servlet-mapping>
			<listener>	
				</listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
			</listener>
			<context-param>
				<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
				<param-value>
					spring-dispatcher-servlet.xml
				</param-value>
			</context-param>
			<filter>
				<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChaing</filter-name>
				<filter-class>org.spirngframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
			</filter>
			<filter-mapping>
				<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChaing</filter-name>
				<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
			</filter-mapping>
			
			
			
		</web-app>
		
		
		
	spring-security-config.xml
	
		<beans>
		
			<http>
				<intercept-url pattern="/welcome*" access="ROLE_USER"/>
				<http-basic />
			</http>
			<authentication-manager>
				<authentication-provider>
					<user-service>
						<user name="abc" password="123" authorities="ROLE_USER"/>
					</user-service>
				</authentication-provider>
			</authentication-manager>
		</beans>

-	http tag is an interceptor and it intercepts all the incoming messages and validates user details using authentication manager resources
-	Authentication mechanism can be DB, Plain text, LDAP
-	Before dispatching request to controller, request will be intercepted by http and validates the authentication
-	Authentication can be basic or login form or custom login page
	
	<http>
		<intercept-url pattern="/welcome*" access="ROLE_USER"/>
		<http-basic />
	</http>
	
	<http>
		<intercept-url pattern="/welcome*" access="ROLE_USER"/>
		<form-login />
		<logout logout-success-url="/home"/>
	</http>

	
	<http auto-config="true">
		<intercept-url pattern="/welcome*" access="ROLE_USER">
		<form-login login-page="/login" default-target-url="/welcome" authentication-failure-url="/loginFailed" />
		<logout logout-success-url="/logout" />
	</http>
